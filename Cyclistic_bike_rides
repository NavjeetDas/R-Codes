```


## Ordering the weeks and the months in proper format

```{r Properly Ordering Week Days and Months}
bike_rides$day_of_week <- ordered(bike_rides$day_of_week, levels = c("Sunday",
      "Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"))
bike_rides$month <- ordered(bike_rides$month,
      levels = c("January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August",
                 "September","October","November","December"))
```


## Summary of rides taken per week

```{r Rides take per Week}

bike_rides %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% #groups by user type and weekday
  na.omit() %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n())
```



## Plot 1: Rides per Day of the Week

```{r Plot 1: Rides per Day of the Week}

bike_rides %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = 'Day of Week', y = 'Total Number of Rides', title = 'Rides per Day of the Week',
       fill = 'Type of Membership') +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(250000, 400000, 550000), 
                     labels = c("250k", "400k", "550k"))
```
The rides per day of week show casual riders peak on the Saturday and Sunday while members peak Monday through Friday. 
This indicates members mainly use the bikes for their commutes from home to work or vice-versa.



## Plot 2: Count of Bike Ride by Hour : from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021

```{r Plot 2: Count of Bike Ride by Hour : from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021}

bike_rides %>%
  count(start_hour, sort = T) %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = start_hour, y = n))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Count of Bike Ride by Hour : from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021",
       x = "Start Hour of Rides", y = "Number of Rides")
```
This trend line showing the count of bike rides by hours clearly indicates that all type of rides were take around 5:00 PM in the evening.
Which can because of users commuting returning back from work to home or for a ride along the beaches and park for their cyclicing exercise and personal errands for the casual riders.



## Plot 3: Rides per Month

```{r Plot 3: Rides per Month}
bike_rides %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>% 
  summarise(total_rides = n(), 'average_duration_(mins)' = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = total_rides, fill = member_casual)) + 
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Total Number of Rides", title = "Rides per Month", fill = "Type of Membership") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(100000, 200000, 300000, 400000),labels = c("100k", "200k", "300k", "400k")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```
The rides per month show that casual riders were a lot more active during the summer months (June - August) than the long-term. 
Conversly, the winter months (November - February) show very little activity on the part of the casual users. 
The long-term users are more active in the winter and spring months


## Plot 4: Type of Bikes used

```{r Plot 4: Type of Bikes used}

bike_rides %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rideable_type, fill = member_casual)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x= 'Type of Bike', y='Number of Rentals', title='Type of Bikes used', fill = 'Type of Membership') +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(500000, 1000000, 1500000), labels = c("500k", "1 mil", "1.5 mil"))

```
The breakdown of which type of bike is the most popular among either type of user.
Showing among the two types of bikes classic and electric. Both types of memberships prefer using the classic bike more so than the electric bike.
The long-term memebrs are also seen to be of the two types favours the classic bike.



## Plot 5: Average ride time per week

```{r Plot 5: Average ride time per week}
bike_rides %>%    #Find the average time spent riding by each membership type per individual day
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, day_of_week)  %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + labs(x='Days of the week', y='Average duration - Mins', 
                                      title='Average ride time per week', fill='Type of Membership')


```
The average ride time shows a huge difference between the casuals and members.
Casuals overall spend more time using the service than their full time members.


Key takeaways / Insights

Casual users tended to ride more so in the warmer months of Chicago, namely June- August. Their participation exceeded that of the long term members.
To further that the Casual demographic spent on average a lot longer time per ride than their long-term counter-parts.
The days of the week also further shows that causal riders prefer to use the service during the weekends as their usage peaked then. The long term members conversly utilised the service more-so throughout the typical work week i.e (Monday- friday)
Long term riders tended to stick more so to classic bikes as opposed to the docked or electric bikes.


Recommendations / Action

Introducing plans thats may be more appealing to casuals for the summer months. This marketing should be done during the winter months in preparation.
The casual users might be more interested in a memebership option that allows for per-use balance card. Alternatively, the existing payment structure may be altered in order to make single-use more costly to the casual riders as well as lowering the long-term membership rate.
Membership rates specifically for the warmer months as well as for those who only ride on the weekends would assist in targeting the casual riders more specifically
