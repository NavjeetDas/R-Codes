Creating summary of the data using metric. The key metric used here is average using the aggregate funtion mean().


avg_ratings <- best_seller %>% 
  group_by(year, genre) %>% 
  summarize("average_ratings" = mean(user_rating))
  
  
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the `.groups`
## argument.


head(avg_ratings)
## # A tibble: 6 × 3
## # Groups:   year [3]
##    year genre       average_ratings
##   <dbl> <chr>                 <dbl>
## 1  2009 Fiction                4.59
## 2  2009 Non Fiction            4.58
## 3  2010 Fiction                4.62
## 4  2010 Non Fiction            4.52
## 5  2011 Fiction                4.62
## 6  2011 Non Fiction            4.51


Creating data visualization. The package ggplot2 is used to make visualizations.

ggplot(avg_ratings) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average_ratings, color = genre, size = 0.02)) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average_ratings, color = genre)) + 
  labs(title = "Average Ratings: Fiction vs. Non Fiction",
       caption = "Viz created by Navjeet Das", x = "Year", y = "Average Ratings")
       
 
##Different view: Seprated both Fiction and Non Fiction using facet_wrap() function.

ggplot(avg_ratings) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average_ratings, color = genre, size = 0.01)) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = average_ratings, color = genre)) + 
  labs(title = "Average Ratings: Fiction vs. Non Fiction",
       caption = "Viz created by Navjeet Das",
       x = "Year", y = "Average Ratings")  + 
  facet_wrap(~genre)
  
   
Bar Graph showing comparision between fiction and non-fiction

ggplot(best_seller) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = genre, fill = genre)) + 
  labs(title = "Popular Genre: Fiction vs. Non Fiction", color = "grey", x = "Genre", y = "Count of Genre")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = "#7F3D17"), panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
 
 
 
Conclusion:
•	The data showing the trend of average rating for Fiction and Non-Fiction books is clear
•	The Fiction book has generate more positive rating compared to the Non-Fiction book
•	And the bar chart shows that even if the Fiction books has gained more ratings
